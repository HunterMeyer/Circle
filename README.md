## First step is download this repository
You'll need `git` first and foremost. Open the Terminal app type:
```
brew install git
```
Then change to a directory where you want to download this app. Maybe something like, /Users/your_name/Projects/:
```
cd /Users/your_name
mkdir Projects
git clone https://github.com/HunterMeyer/Circle
cd Circle
```

For the next steps you'll want to keep Terminal open and make sure you're in the Circle directory.

## Next step is to setup the dependencies for this app
It's easier to read [React-Native's documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to figure this out.
